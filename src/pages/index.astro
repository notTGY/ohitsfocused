                                        Look, I have trouble even mentioning,
                                        even saying to myself in my own head the number of years.
                                        I no more think of myself as being as old as I am than fly.
                                        I mean, it's just not...
                                        I haven't observed anything in terms of...
                                        There's not things I don't do now that I did before,
                                        whether it's physical or mental or anything else.
